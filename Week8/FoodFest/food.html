    <h3>A food festival is a festival that focuses on food, often locally produced cuisine,
         as its core topic. These festivals have long served to bring communities together 
         by celebrating harvests and offering appreciation for a bountiful farming season.
          The primary goal of the food festival is to reintroduce value into food systems
           and food culture. Communities become aware of the necessity of resurrecting their
            traditional food practices and production as a result of such festivals, resulting
             in enhanced local resilience and food security. They beautify their meals by 
             presenting traditional dishes and explaining and recording the cultural and 
             ecological connections. Food festivals are diverse community-driven activities 
             that empower people from the ground up</h3>
