                <p>When Hanu Raghavapudi debuted in 2012 with the beautiful Andala 
                    Rakshasi, the audience had high hopes from him that were somewhat 
                    trashed thanks to films that followed.</p>
                <p>Dulquer and Mrunal steal the show in Sita Ramam. For a film like this to 
                    work, you need to be invested in their story and the actors do a good job 
                    in ensuring that.</p>

                <p>Director Mahesh Babu Pachigolla’s Miss Shetty Mr Polishetty is a mixed 
                    bag. While the film discusses a topic not much brought up in Telugu 
                    cinema, it also follows the same ol’ tropes every rom-com does, which 
                    doesn’t always work in its favour.</p>
                    <p>Naveen delivers a good performance, the role he plays seems 
                        ‘tailor-made’ for him. He falters in a few emotional scenes but 
                        it’s nothing you can’t get over. Anushka looks adorable on-screen 
                        and pulls off the role of an independent woman who doesn’t like 
                        emotional baggage well. Radhan’s music is okay, with the songs not 
                        adding much to the narrative. Hathavidhi is the only number that 
                        gels well with the proceedings. Tulsi, who plays Sidhu's mom, is 
                        hilarious in some scenes while Murli Sharma, who plays his father, 
                        is dependable as ever, especially in the pre-climax.</p>

                <h3 class="container text-success">Spy</h3>
                <p>Jai Vardhan (Nikhil Siddhartha) is a RAW agent on the lookout for 
                    answers. His brother Subhash (Aryan Rajesh) was proclaimed dead during

                    </p>
                <p>SPY comes at a time when you’ve kind of seen various permutations and 
                    combinations of the same story told in different ways with varying 
                    motivations in numerous languages. Garry’s film has its heart in the 
                    right place, but it lacks the spunk to stand out.</p>

                <h3 class="container text-success">Gautam Nanda</h3>
                <p>Broadly centered on the lines of Mark Twain’s The Prince and The Pauper, 
                    which has been adapted on big screen many a time, this movie underscores 
                    the value of Gautam Buddha’s teaching that greed is the root cause of all 
                    evil. Director Sampath Nandi has attempted an off-beat treatment to the 
                    story while peppering it with commercial elements.</p>
                <p>Goutham Gattamaneni (Gopichand) is the only son of Vishnu Prasad Gattamaneni
                     (Sachin Khedekar), who features among the Top 50 billionaires in the world.
                      The fun-loving guy, who’s being wooed by Mugdha (Catherine Tresa), decides 
                      to take an extreme step when he sets out to find who he is. Being born with 
                      a silver spoon, Goutham wants to experience all the flavours of life — 
                      happiness, hunger, troubles and triumph.</p>

                <h3 class="container text-success">Whistle</h3>
                <p>Whistle' has been described by its makers as a sports drama with loads 
                    of action thrown in.  In reality, the film shows football matches like 
                    how Sankranthi cockfights used to be shown in second-rate village 
                    dramas of the 1990s.  Those films in which rivals would resort to 
                    cheap tricks, deceptions and machinations to win the game by hook 
                    or crook.  Those films in which it's not about the game but about 
                    egos.  In 'Whistle', the coach, manager or whoever from the other 
                    side, speak like the dons of an underworld gang.  Jackie Shroff 
                    gatecrashed into this film straight from the tomb where he was buried 
                    in 'Saaho'.  </p>

                <p>A love story of two individuals who are poles apart in their approach 
                    to life. Vikram Aditya a renowned Palmist who does not believe in love 
                    but believes in the language of stars, fate, destiny falls in love with
                     Prerna who believes more in science than destiny and fate.The 
                     picturisation of some of the songs reminds you of the good ol’e 
                     music videos made several years ago. The VFX deserves an applause, 
                     and adds to the visual quality of the film. But all of this barely 
                     salvages this love story whose destiny could have really been 
                     something else.
